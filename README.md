It uses Docker and Docker Compose for an easy and reproducible setup.
Please note it was modified to fit the use case of the Deutsche Waldjugend.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lwijshoff/waldjugend-docker.git
  cd waldjugend-docker
  ```

2. **Configure environment variables**  
  Rename the example `.env` file and adjust it to your needs:
  ```bash
  mv .env.example .env
  ```
  Edit `.env` with your preferred editor (database name, user, password, ports, etc.).

  > [!CAUTION]  
  > Pick strong, long and random passwords, as they may otherwise grant unauthorized people access to your database. 

3. **Configure WordPress settings**  
  There is a `config.ini` file in the `/rsc` directory. Adjust it as needed for your environment.

4. **Start the containers**  
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```
  This will start WordPress, the database, and other required services in the background.

> [!TIP]  
> It might take some time for the database to get up and running.

## Usage

- **Access WordPress**:  
  Once everything is running, open your browser and go to:  
  ```
  http://localhost
  ```
  (or replace `localhost` with your serverâ€™s IP/hostname).

- **Stop containers**:  
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
  These volumes are persistent, so your data is retained. Unless you delete the `wordpress_data` and `db_data` volumes.

- **View logs**:  
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```

---

## Notes

- Use `.env` to customize **database credentials**.  
- `config.ini` in `/rsc` [contains php.ini directives](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php).  
- This setup is mainly intended for **local development** and **testing**.  
  For production use, consider adding HTTPS, backups, and security hardening.
